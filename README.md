# Secure TCP Chat Room

## Overview

The Secure TCP Chat Room is a Python-based client-server application that enables encrypted and confidential communication between multiple users over TCP. The project demonstrates practical knowledge of networking fundamentals, secure communication concepts, and socket programming.


### Features
- Encrypted messaging to ensure confidentiality
- TCP-based client-server architecture
- Support for multiple concurrent users
- Reliable message delivery using TCP sockets
- Clear separation of client and server logic

### Technologies Used
- Python
- TCP Sockets
- Networking Protocols
- Encryption Techniques (e.g., symmetric or asymmetric encryption, depending on implementation)

### Architecture

The application follows a traditional TCP client-server model:
- The server listens for incoming client connections and manages message routing.
- Each client establishes a TCP connection to the server and securely sends and receives messages.
- Encryption is applied before transmission and decrypted upon receipt to protect data in transit.

### Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates:
- Strong understanding of TCP/IP networking concepts
- Practical experience with Python socket programming
- Awareness of secure communication principles
